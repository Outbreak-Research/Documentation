<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This is based mostly on the more complete tables of Outbreak File 2. It also applies to Outbreak File 1.</p>
<p>With this release, I am including my recent research into the data that appears in both of the original Japanese retail versions of
File 1 and File 2, as well as the U.S. Public Beta 1.0 gametest disc for Outbreak File 1. Anything significant from these will be
noted as "Japanese" and "Public Beta" respectively.</p>
<p>This is the first version of this document to include preliminary tables for all items you can obtain in the game - either in normal
gameplay or high-poly cutscene forms.</p>
<p>My thanks to Rusty, DXP, and all their friends over at the RE 123 Modding Forums for their original research.</p>
<h2 id="general-observations">General Observations<a class="headerlink" href="#general-observations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Here's a good rule-of-thumb regarding Outbreak character model resolutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Super lo-res/lo-poly (&gt;1200 polys) - distance shots of zombies</li>
<li>Lo-res/lo-poly (~2000 polys) - general gameplay</li>
<li>Mid-res/mid-poly (~3500 polys) - main characters and some cutscene models</li>
<li>Hi-res/hi-poly (&gt;7000 polys) - almost all cutscene models</li>
</ul>
<p>Likewise, gameplay objects will be fairly low in poly count (usually less than 1000 polys, frequently less than 300)
and cutscene objects fairly high (2000-3000 or higher).</p>
<p>You'll soon learn that Outbreak uses the same basic generic face types for various different NPC and zombie characters.
Each looks different because these generic faces are mapped differently on different models - as well as having different hair,
zombie features (blood, bruisers, etc.), minor tweaking of facial features to better fit the model, and so on.
If you spend enough time with these models, you'll also learn to spot most of the basic face types. You can have a lot of fun
swapping these around yourself to create all-new Outbreak characters, as I did with my custom Ellen Long - a female RPD officer
with Elena's face on Kathy's head and attached to Rita's body.</p>
<p>Some models have more than one version - with or without certain gear and clothes, normal or zombie versions, and so on.
I've tried to distinguish which is which.</p>
<p>A fair amount of Outbreak data got reused for the two Chronicles games (REUC &amp; REDC). I've tried to let you know when that occurs.
Generally speaking, ported Outbreak models - especially zombies or NPCs - are usually fairly easy to spot because they will have
only one or two texture tiles - although they might be large ones intended for high-poly models. With Outbreak models, in most
cases, it will use one texture for everything, or the first will generally be for the head and the second for the rest of the body.
High-poly model textures from later Resident Evil games - beginning with RE0 and RE1R - tend to have anywhere from three to six
textures (as of 2014), and these are usually for dedicated body parts - head, torso, limbs, and so on. This is not a hard-and-fast
rule - especially where monsters and mutants are concerned - but it helps.</p>

<h3 id="n20x-player-character-cameos">N20x - Player Character Cameos<a class="headerlink" href="#n20x-player-character-cameos" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>This is set up as a continuation of the gameplay NPC table, due to the way Outbreak treats player character cameos.</p>
<p>The Outbreak series apparently uses a player character cameo model whenever it needs to generate one specifically for an event in
a given scenario. This feature is used a lot in Outbreak File 2. For example, Cindy will appear at the gate to the zoo of
"Wild Things" if she has not been selected by (any of) the player(s), and she will be killed there (!) when Oscar (the mutant
elephant) begins his rampage. Here's another example. If not chosen as a player character, David will appear as a zombie in the
Sewers near the ladder that leads up to the street outside the Apple Inn in "End of the Road." I've personally seen Kevin and
Yoko appear as zombies in other scenarios as well under similar circumstances (they aren't picked by any players).
This is my best guess at present as to why the N20x table exists for player characters. For modding/hacking purposes, these models
are identical to the regular player character gameplay models and can be treated as such.</p>
<p>There are no player character cameo models of alternate outfits, although they could undoubtedly be swapped in as needed with the
appropriate data from the normal player character model table.</p>

<li>N201 - Mark</li>

<p>None of the currently available textures will map properly with the unused zombies. Parts of them can be made to work, but usually
the head won't map right. For example, none of the USS character textures, either normal human or zombie, will map properly with
the unused Miguel zombie. Parts of the uniform can be made to work, but that's about it. I wound up having to hack my own custom
texture for the Miguel zombie. You will have to do the same if you plan on texturing these unused models yourself.</p>
<p>Ricky's cutscene model texture (slot HN008) can almost be made to work (!) with the unused Subway Worker Zombie 1 (slot E036) -
provided you retool it so that it is arranged like those of the other Subway Worker Zombies. The only parts that don't match up
are the (overlaid zombie) eyes and ears, but these may have been located in the proper places on the original low-poly texture
(if it existed). This could mean that Capcom originally had plans for Ricky to re-animate during "Underbelly" after you found him,
and then abandoned those plans - but I'm speculating.</p>
<p>Some of the enemies farther down the enemies table have what seem to be rather high poly counts that defy the general rules of thumb. Bear in mind that these are models of LARGE enemies - so they will have high poly counts as a result. You can compare the few that also exist in the high-poly enemies table to see just how big a difference in detail (usually three times the polys) exist between the two.</p>

E23 - Gamma hunter (smaller version used in REDC)
E24 - Centipede (&quot;Flash Back?&quot;)
E25 - Mutant Neptune shark (&quot;The Docks&quot; and &quot;Decisions, Decisions&quot;)
E26 - Mutant Neptune shark, repeated (&quot;The Docks&quot; and &quot;Decisions, Decisions&quot;)
E27 - Leechman with arms extended, different character bases (&quot;The Hive&quot;)

00 - Leechman Kevin
01 - Leechman Mark

04 - Leechman David
05 - Leechman Alyssa
06 - Leechman Yoko
07 - Leechman Cindy
08 - Leechman Hirsh
09 - Leechman Scott Jones (original base)

E28 - Birkin form 1 holding a slime-covered Matthew (unused)

NOTE - Birkin NEVER APPEARS in Outbreak, save in pre-release trailers made
back when the game was still in its earliest private beta testing phases.
He was supposed to appear in at least the &quot;USS scenario.&quot; This probably
explains why Birkin is grouped with the G-Mutant in the enemy data tables.
This appears to be a low-poly version of the Birkin form 1 mutant that
appears in the Outbreak File 1 opening credits (but without Matthew in his
right hand, of course).

E29 - G-Mutant

00 - Full form G-mutant (Outbreak&#39;s is different than RE2 and REDC!)
01 - G-Embryo
02 - G-Mutant gibs

E31 - Naked fat zombie with sewn-up stomach (unused)
E32 - Oscar the infected elephant (&quot;Wild Things&quot;)
E33 - Infected lions (&quot;Wild Things&quot;)

00 - Male lion
02 - Lioness (female)

E34_01 - Upright mutant plant stalk (&quot;Flash Back&quot;)

NOTE - There&#39;s apparently bad data at this point starting with the Japanese
original. Both the coatless normal Tyrant and the long-armed, one-armed
prototype Tyrant also appear here, in slots E34_01 and E34_02 respectively.
Were they originally supposed to appear in &quot;Flash Back?&quot; It would be in
keeping with &quot;Flash Back&#39;s&quot; unique origins. It is based on an abandoned
sequel to RE1 known as BIOHAZARD DASH. Tyrants would have been encountered
in the basement levels of the DASH original of the hospital. Probably just
a coincidence; even so ....

E35 - Mobile plant root (&quot;Flash Back&quot;)
E36 - Scissortail (E36_00 and E36_02 are brown, E36_01 is &quot;Flash Back&quot; dark gray)
E37 - EXTREMELY low-poly zombies with darkened textures (only 85 or so polys!)

00 - Mathhew Zombie
01 - Robert Zombie
02 - Colin Zombie
03 - Robert Zombie (repeated)

E38 - Moth cocoon for victim
E39 - Grubworm (moth larvae, &quot;Below Freezing Point&quot;)
E40 - Prototype Thantos Tyrant, RE1 style but simpler (unused)
(somewhat similar to REUC&#39;s slot ETY1 but closer to old RE1 version)
E41 - Normal Tyrant, &quot;Mister X&quot; outfit (see also REDC slot T103)
(Elimination Tyrant is the same but with red-tinted texture applied)

Variations (File 2 only)

00 - &quot;Mister X&quot; outfit
01 - Transformed, retail version
02 - &quot;Mister X&quot; outfit (repeated)
03 - Elimination Tyrant (red &quot;Mister X&quot; but has spiked head and is VERY fast)

E42 - Thanatos Tyrant transformed, retail version
E43 - Thanatos Tyrant

00 - Classic RE1 style, without clothes or gear (unused, not transformed)
01 - Transformed and injured, only one arm

E44 - Prototype Injured Thanatos Tyrant (one very long arm and one short arm)
(probably early or original form of E43_01)
E45 - Axeman Al with axe (&quot;Flash Back&quot;)
E46 - Large flower bloom (&quot;Flash Back&quot;)

00 - Closed
01 - Open

E47 - Pitcher plant (&quot;Flash Back&quot;)

00 - Main blossom or &quot;pitcher&quot;
01 - Long horizontal tentacle or vine (appears to be fixed to roof)

E48 - Normal sized bee (&quot;Flash Back&quot;)

<p>SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING BETA HIGH-POLY ENEMIES</p>
<p>Not all of the high poly zombies that were created for Outbreak appear in the data tables; however, some of these missing ones
eventually wound up in the two Chronicles games (REUC &amp; REDC). Almost two dozen Outbreak high-poly enemy models were among the
Outbreak assets reused (and updated) for the Chronicles series. In such cases, I will attempt to show you both where they should
have gone in the Outbreak data tables, and where they can be found in the appropriate Chronicles game. It should be noted that all
of the Outbreak models that got reused for Chronicles received both updated models AND textures, so they may look slightly different
than their older Outbreak counterparts.</p>

<p>SPECIAL NOTES REGARDING NPC MODELS</p>
<p>There's an alternate version of the MacDowell beta placeholder model that occasionally appears in the NPC gameplay tables. It has
texture mapping issues with the head, but this might be an NBDX ripping/conversion error. I've only listed the first occurrence.</p>
<p>Both Clint and Bone are believed to belong to "The Docks," based on their proximity to Austin and Clint's clothing (he's wearing a
life vest). Austin was apparently the pilot of the ship in "The Docks" before being reallocated to "Wild Things," per a surviving
beta test gameplay still.</p>
<p>The name of the NPC zombie that occupies slot 30 is officially unknown. My guess is that it is Jack, the owner of Jack's Bar
("J's Bar" in the game) based on his proximity to Bob and his clothing. His outfit is not unlike Will's save for the color, and
Will is the bartender there ....</p>
<p>I'm fairly certain that Jake and Gary were intended for "A Day in Raccoon," as they're grouped with Mickey in the game data.
Jake appears to be some kind of official, possibly an Umbrella executive. He's a George type, with appropriate medical gear, when
enabled for gameplay. Gary is probably an old acquaintance - possibly antagonistic - and that would make Richard Jake's bodyguard.
Gary is unique, whereas Richard appears to be a variation on UBCS Arnold, and is most likely an undercover USS operative who was
assigned the job of guarding Jake. Richard's presence, if I am right, would explain why both Gary and Mickey are shot dead during
the course of "A Day in Raccoon," and later revive as zombies. Other fans have their own opinions and theories ....</p>
<p>The Yoko as Umbrella researcher model ("Yoko Z" in the game data) is from the opening cutscene to "Outbreak," the game's very first
scenario. That's why it has long hair.</p>
<p>The unused nurse model appears to be an injured version of Raccoon Hospital's Kathy (it has Kathy's head). Elena's head will also
work with it, although the mesh for their newer outfits won't map correctly on the older model. I wound up having to make my own
custom texture in order to properly recreate this model.</p>
<p>Rodney does not appear in any gameplay scenario in either File 1 or File 2 as far as I know; however, he can be earned as a playable
character. He may have been part of the development for "Streets," and his story would have most likely been told in the unreleased
Outbreak File 3.</p>

<h3 id="hnxxx-high-poly-npc-meshes">HNxxx - High-Poly NPC Meshes<a class="headerlink" href="#hnxxx-high-poly-npc-meshes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The high-resolution meshes are for cutscenes only. Some game characters exist only as hi-res meshes - like Tommy Neilson, for
instance. A small handful of cutscene models (Len, Kurt, etc.) are mid-poly models instead of high-poly ones. I can but guess as
to the reason why. Fan hackers have found various ways to use the cutscene models within the game itself, but that discussion lies
well beyond the scope of this document.</p>
<p>There's a medium-res version of the beta version of UBCS MacDowell that gets repeated again and again as a placeholder. I'm only
listing its first appearance, save for one important exception (see table).</p>
<p>The sheer number of unused cutscene models ALONE for "Flash Back" point to a far larger (and probably more entertaining) earlier
version of this most unique of Outbreak's many scenarios. It (and they) probably got cut due to release deadlines and the fact that
Outbreak File 1 did not sell as well as had been hoped. It's a shame, because it looks like it would have played a lot closer to its
source (the synopsis for the undeveloped RE1 sequel BIOHAZARD DASH) than what we ultimately got.</p>
<p>Of all of the unused high-poly NPC cutscene models, there is only one remaining for which I cannot clearly associate any given
gameplay scenario. That is the one I have come to call the "U.S.S. Commander" (slot HN087). My placing him with the lost U.S.S.
scenario is a best guess based on his outfit alone. He could in fact belong to any of the early version, unreleased, or undeveloped
Outbreak scenarios.</p>
<p>The cutscene model for Joseph Murrows that was developed for "Wild Things" ultimately went unused. Apparently he was to have been
the one who was crushed to death at the zoo gate whenever Oscar the elephant makes his first appearance. That part was given to
Cindy instead (in a cameo appearance) for the retail release of Outbreak File 2.</p>

<p>These are all grouped together in what I have (somewhat affectionately) come to call "the big pile of s--t." When you rip them and
then attempt to load the resulting OBJ file, be sure to turn off "Load as single mesh" or whatever similar option exists in your
favorite 3D modeling program. It's the only way you can load them individually.</p>
<p>While many objects are the same across gameplay scenarios, there are a few that are not. What I am going to do is give you a list
of the items that most people seem to want to find. Things like weapons, healing items, and so on. I'll also throw in some rather
unique items that some of you would probably like to have for your Outbreak mesh model collection - even though they might exist only
as a low-poly model. While it won't be a complete list of EVERY single item, this should be mostly complete in terms of uniqueness
of the item(s) in question.</p>
<p>Just because I don't list something in a given scenario's "pile of s--t" doesn't mean it's not there. Common items, such as
9mm handguns, 9mm ammo boxes, potted herbs of healing, and so on are present in ALL scenario object data clusters. I just didn't
feel like listing all of them every single time.</p>
<p>If you're looking mainly for low-poly weapons, your quickest path is to search the
data clusters for the Elimination or Extra Battle scenarios. That way you'll get most of them at one shot.</p>

<p>Once you start to tear into the Outbreak scenario data, you'll see a group of files that are named according to the following
general format:</p>
<p>File name format:</p>
<p>OBJnn_nn_L_nn ... - High-poly object(s) that appear within a scenario</p>
<p>These are "hero" or high-poly versions of Outbreak's common objects, which are intended solely for in-game cutscene use.
The number of high-poly objects in the Outbreak series are quite limited in comparison to the gameplay resolution ones (both common
and scenario-specific); however, there are some in this table that appear nowhere else within the series.</p>
<p>Multiple copies of these appear, usually for different versions of in-game generated cutscenes (for different player characters).
I'm only going to list the FIRST time a particular high-poly object appears in the scenario data table. It's a waste of time listing
every single instance or occurrence, as the repeated data is identical.</p>

<h3 id="bonus-quick-list-of-outbreak-scenario-numbers">BONUS - Quick List of Outbreak Scenario Numbers<a class="headerlink" href="#bonus-quick-list-of-outbreak-scenario-numbers" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Outbreak scenarios appear to have been numbered in the order that they were conceived or created, and not when they were intended for
release. Capcom's programmers also deliberately left gaps in the sequence, as they were planning an entire series of Outbreak games.
They also backtracked on the numbering scheme in File 2's case, which makes things even more confusing for the Outbreak researcher.
I've seen public statements and magazine articles talking about up to eighteen scenarios all told in various stages of development
across the three intended retail released (Files 1-3), but no more. It should be noted there are slots in the Outbreak scenario
table for far more than that.</p>
<p>In most cases, all of the texture files for rooms and room objects within a given scenario share the same room number prefix as the
scenario itself ... but there ARE some interesting exceptions. Some scenarios apparently got renumbered and moved during the
development process. "The Hive," for instance, apparently originally existed in slot R019 early on, and then got moved wholesale
to slot R028 - for reasons still unknown. All of its texture tiles have the prefix "R019" instead of "R028," as they should have
been. "Desperate Times" has three different sets of texture tiles, with prefixes of R015, R019, and R40 respectively. Apparently
this also got revised a lot during development, which may help explain why it was not released until File 2. There are several other
examples of this. The room/texture naming scheme alone appears to point to four additional Outbreak scenarios that either never got
released or existed in forms earlier than what wound up released for retail.</p>
<p>Most fans believe that "Hellfire" replaced "A Day in Raccoon," and several fan experts have noted numerous similarities between the
rooms and textures for both. It's quite possible that "A Day in Raccoon" originally occupied slot R002 and was subsequently
overwritten by "Hellfire" for retail release. If true, this would help explain the similarities between them - but this is
speculation on my part.</p>
<p>I do not know where either of the two other documented unreleased Outbreak scenarios - "The Streets of Raccoon City" and "The Docks"
- fit into this scenario naming scheme. I've made a wild-ass guess in the case of "Streets" - but in either case, there simply isn't
enough data to be certain.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>R001 - &quot;Outbreak&quot; (File 1) (This is the oldest of all scenarios - &quot;OutbreaK&quot; is its official name)
R002 - &quot;Hellfire&quot; (File 2) (May have overwritten &quot;A Day in Raccoon&quot; in this slot?)
R004 - unreleased (This was probably the original version of &quot;Below Freezing Point&quot; - which is also known as the lost U.S.S. scenario)
R006 - &quot;End of the Road&quot; (File 2)
R010 - &quot;Underbelly&quot; (File 1)
R015 - &quot;Desperate Times&quot; (File 2)
R016 - unreleased (lots of city-based texture tiles came from here - is this where &quot;Streets&quot; went?)
R019 - unreleased(This was probably the original version of &quot;The Hive&quot; - the one that also had the EXTERIOR of Raccoon Hospital as well as the park across the street, per RE3 and early game trailers)
R020 - practice level (based on File 1&#39;s &quot;Outbreak&quot;)
R021 - Elimination/Battle level - mixed rooms (?)
R022 - Elimination/Battle level - mixed rooms (?)
R023 - Elimination/Battle level - mixed rooms (?)
R026 - &quot;Flash Back&quot; (File 2)
(There were apparently plans for a somewhat different version of &quot;Flash Back&quot;
that did not make it to retail. Some of the early trailer shots don&#39;t agree
with the retail data, and unused [but present] cutscene models exist that
appear to point to events that took place six years earlier. Only allusions
and references to these past events appear in the final retail version. The
fully rendered cutscene models for both the younger Al and Dorothy Lester
are part of this data - only a picture of them exists in gameplay proper.)
R027 - Elimination/Battle level - mixed rooms (?)
R028 - &quot;The Hive&quot; (retail version) (Almost all of its texture tiles originally belonged to R019)
R029 - Elimination/Battle level - mixed rooms (?)
R030 - Elimination/Battle level - mixed rooms (?)
R035 - &quot;Below Freezing Point&quot; (File 1)(Most of its texture tiles originally belonged to R004)
R039 - unreleased(A scene involving an aerial tram car from this lost scenario appears in some Elimination or Battle levels. That is all that is known about it.)
R040 - &quot;Wild Things&quot; (File 2) (this appears to have been the last official addition to the scenario lineup for retail release - texture data from it appears in the final retail version of &quot;Desperate Times&quot;)
R041 - &quot;Decisions, Decisions&quot; (File 1)
