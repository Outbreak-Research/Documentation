### Definitions

- MC scaling: How much MC model is scaled
- NPC scaling: How much NPC model is scaled
- NPC animation speed: How much fast NPC moving animations are played

### Equations

- NPC speed ${\displaystyle = {NPCscaling * NPCanimationSpeed * 100}}$

- MC speed ${\displaystyle = {MCscaling * 100}}$

This formula isn't 100% accurate because it doesn't consider the character type animation duration.

### Examples
#### MC

- Kevin scaling = 1.05
- Kevin speed = 1.05 * 100 = 105%

#### NPC

- MacDowell scaling = 1
- MacDowell animation speed = 1.04
- MacDowell speed = 1.04 * 1 * 100 = 104%
