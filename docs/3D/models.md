shadows data

Each MC has a uniquely well-defined shadow that is shaped like their body and interacts according to light sources in a room.
NPCs only have a dim circular shadow that does not seem to adjust to the light sources in a room.
OBTool includes/preserves this data when converting between .OBJ and .FBX.
